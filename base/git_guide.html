    <h><b>What is Git</b></h>
    <p>Git allows you to version control your code.
        This code will be stored in a git repository.
        On your device, this will look like a folder than contains your project.
    </p>

    <p>Git allows you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Back up your code</li>
            <li>Get your code on any device and sync changes</li>
            <li>Pull in other changes that other people have made to a piece of code</li>
            <li>Track the history of changes to code - and revert to previous version if needed</li>
        </ul> 

    </p>

    <h><b>How is Git used</b></h>

    <p><b>Starting a Project</b></p>
    <p>You can create a project that uses git by making a folder for your project, and running the 
        "git init" terminal command in this folder. 
        You will then be able to track changes made in this folder with git.
    </p>

    <p>If you are unsure how to access the location you want through the terminal, you can right click 
        the folder you want to access through file explorer and choose the "open in terminal option". 
        This will open your terminal in the right location for you to run the terminal commands. 
        If you need to move to a subfolder with "cd foldername" and move to the parent folder with "cd .."
    </p>

    <p><b>GitHub</b></p>

    <p>Git repositories can hosted on sites like GitHub. 
        On the GitHub website, you will find a project page for each repository hosted there.
        The repository on the GitHub website is know as a remote repository, which means that it is 
        hosted on a server accessible to others. You can access the code in this repository on your device 
        by running "git clone CLONE_ID" - where CLONE_ID is a specific address that can be found on the project 
        page - in the location you would like to store the code. The version of the repository that you have
        cloned to your device is know as a local repository, as it can only be accessed locally. 
    </p>

    <p><b>Making Changes to Code</b></p>

    <p>Before you make any changes, make sure your local code is up to date with the remote repository.
        Run "git pull" to do this.
    </p>

    <p>You can make changes to the code in the local repository on your machine in the same way you would edit 
        any other code. You will then have to "add" these changes to a staging area by running "git add filename", 
        where filename is the path to the file you have changed. You can check what files you need to add by 
        using the "git status" command. You can use "git add ." to add all the files.
    </p>

    <p>After you have added all your files, you need to add a message explaining the changes you have made. 
        Run "git commit -m "message here" with your own message. This command will apply to all the files you have 
        added. 
    </p>

    <p>These changes are currently only available to you locally. You can apply these changes to the remote repository 
        by using the "git push" command. Afterwards, your changes should be available in the remote repository.
    </p>

    <p><b>Getting Changes from a Remote Repository</b></p>

    <p>Changes pushed from one local repository are not automatically applied to any other existing local repositories.
        If somebody else is working on code from the same remote repository, or you are working on a different device, 
        you will have to ask git to get the changes yourself. You can get and apply the changes to your local repository 
        by using the "git pull" command. 
    </p>

    <p>You should run this command before you make and push changes to ensure that your local branch is up to date 
        and you do not introduce any conflicts. 
    </p>

    <p><b>Typical Workflow</b></p>

    <p>So a typical git workflow from your local code would be something like:
    <ul>
        <li>Check for and apply any changes that have been made to the remote repository</li>
        <li>Add the files that you have made changes to the staging area</li>
        <li>Add a commit message explainging the changes you have made</li>
        <li>Push the changes to the remote repository</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    <p>Or, in translated into commands:
    <ul>
        <li>git pull</li>
        <li>git add filename</li>
        <li>git commit -m "my commit message"</li>
        <li>git push</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
