    <div id="what_is_git"></div>
    <h2><b>What is Git</b></h2>
    <p>Git allows you to version control your code.
        This code will be stored in a git repository.
        On your device, this will look like a folder than contains your project.
    </p>

    <p>Git allows you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Back up your code</li>
            <li>Get your code on any device and sync changes</li>
            <li>Pull in other changes that other people have made to a piece of code</li>
            <li>Track the history of changes to code - and revert to previous version if needed</li>
        </ul> 

    </p>

    <div id="how_is_git_used"></div>
    <h2><b>How is Git used</b></h2>

    <div id="starting_a_project"></div>
    <p><b>Starting a Project</b></p>
    <p>You can create a project that uses git by making a folder for your project, and running the command 
        <code>git init</code> in your terminal within this folder. You will then be able to track changes made in this 
        folder with git.
    </p>

    <p>If you are unsure how to access the location you want through the terminal, you can right click 
        the folder you want to access through file explorer and choose the "open in terminal option". 
        This will open your terminal in the right location for you to run the terminal commands. 
        If you need to move to a subfolder with <code>cd foldername"</code> and move to the parent 
        folder with <code>cd ..</code>
    </p>

    <div id="github"></div>
    <p><b>GitHub</b></p>

    <p>Git repositories can hosted on sites like GitHub. 
        On the GitHub website, you will find a project page for each repository hosted there.
        The repository on the GitHub website is know as a remote repository, which means that it is 
        hosted on a server accessible to others. You can access the code in this repository on your device 
        by running <code>git clone CLONE_ID</code> - where <code>CLONE_ID</code> is a specific address that 
        can be found on the project page - in the location you would like to store the code. The version of 
        the repository that you have cloned to your device is know as a local repository, as it can only be 
        accessed locally. 
    </p>

    <div id="making_changes_to_code"></div>
    <p><b>Making Changes to Code</b></p>

    <p>Before you make any changes, make sure your local code is up to date with the remote repository.
        Run <code>git pull</code> to do this.
    </p>

    <p>You can make changes to the code in the local repository on your machine in the same way you would edit 
        any other code. You will then have to "add" these changes to a staging area by running <code>git add filename</code>, 
        where filename is the path to the file you have changed. You can check what files you need to add by 
        using the <code>git status</code> command, and <code>git add .</code> to add all the files.
    </p>

    <p>After you have added all your files, you need to add a message explaining the changes you have made. 
        Run <code>git commit -m "message here"</code> with your own message. This command will apply to all 
        the files you have added. 
    </p>

    <p>These changes are currently only available to you locally. You can apply these changes to the remote repository 
        by using the <code>git push</code> command. Afterwards, your changes should be available in the remote repository.
    </p>

    <div id="getting_changes_from_remote"></div>
    <p><b>Getting Changes from a Remote Repository</b></p>

    <p>Changes pushed from one local repository are not automatically applied to any other existing local repositories.
        If somebody else is working on code from the same remote repository, or you are working on a different device, 
        you will have to ask git to get the changes yourself. You can get and apply the changes to your local repository 
        by using the <code>git pull</code> command. 
    </p>

    <p>You should run this command before you make and push changes to ensure that your local branch is up to date 
        and you do not introduce any conflicts. 
    </p>

    <div id="typical_workflow_no_branches"></div>
    <h2><b>Typical Workflow (No Branches)</b></h2>

    <p>So a typical git workflow from your local code would be something like:
    <ul>
        <li>Check for and apply any changes that have been made to the remote repository</li>
        <li>Add the files that you have made changes to the staging area</li>
        <li>Add a commit message explainging the changes you have made</li>
        <li>Push the changes to the remote repository</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    <p>Or, translated into commands:
    <ul>
        <li><code>git pull</code></li>
        <li><code>git add filename</code></li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "my commit message"</code></li>
        <li><code>git push</code></li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    <div id="working_with_others_branches"></div>
    <h2><b>Working With Others: Branches</b></h2>

    <div id="branches"></div>
    <p><b>Branches</b></p>

    <p>If there is more than one person working in a repository, it is common that each person works on their own branch.
        This means, if you were to make and push changes, the other person will not get the changes you have made unless 
        they choose to merge your changes into their own branch. This means you can safetly push changes without conflicting
        with the other person's work.
    </p>

    <p>Typically, there will be a main branch from which the other branches will stem from. Once you are satisfied with the 
        changes you have made to your branch, you can merge your changes to the main branch. Everyone else working on the 
        repository will then be able to <code>git pull</code> these changes from the main branch, and merge them into their
        own.
    </p>

    <div id="branch_commands"></div>
    <p><b>Branch Commands</b></p>

    <p>To see what branch you are currently working on, use the <code>git branch</code> command. You can switch to another
        existing branch with <code>git switch branchname</code>. To make a new branch, use <code>git switch -c branchname</code>.
    </p>

    <p>To apply the changes you have made to another branch, switch to the branch you want to apply your changes to, and then use
        <code>git merge branchname</code>, where <code>branchname</code> is the name of the branch that you have made your changes to.
    </p>

    <div id="typical_workflow_with_branches"></div>
    <h2><b>Typical Workflow (With Branches)</b></h2>

    <p>If you are working on your own branch, your workflow will be something like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Check for and apply any changes that have been made to the remote main 
            repository</li>
        <li>Apply the changes made to the main branch to your own branch</li>
        <li>Add the files that you have made changes to on your own branch to 
            the staging area</li>
        <li>Add a commit message explainging the changes you have made</li>
        <li>Push the changes to the remote repository</li>
        <li>When ready, apply these changes to the main branch</li>
        <li>Push the changes to the remote main repository</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    <p>Or, translated into commands:
    <ul>
        <li><code>git switch your-branch-name</code></li>
        <li><code>git pull</code></li>
        <li><code>git merge main</code></li>
        <li><code>git add filename</code></li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "my commit message"</code></li>
        <li><code>git switch main</code></li>
        <li><code>git merge you-branch-name</code></li>
        <li><code>git push</code></li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
